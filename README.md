## Why?
I'm an active travel photographer, and use various hardware & software-based GPS solutions to geo-tag my images on the fly, all with distinct shortcomings when paired with my ancient (but lovely) Nikon D700. So, I've built a geo-tagging GPS to meet my own specific needs. (See [Disclaimer](#Disclaimer).)

Leveraging what I've learned from an earlier attempt at a mobile GPS-solution (see [Project Pluto](https://github.com/daifukusensei/arduino-gps-logger), I've affectionately named this Project Neptune.

## Features
- Mounts to the bottom of a Nikon D300(S)/D700, and is powered directly from the camera
- Connects to a Nikon D300(S)/D700 camera via Mini-USB-to-10-pin cable for direct geo-tagging of captured images
- Bluetooth pairing with mobile phone or NMEA 0183-compatible device/DSLR (see [Specifications and Requirements](#Specifications-and-Requirements))
- Logging of co-ordinates to microSD card at 2-second intervals
- Waypoint marking upon button press
- LEDs to indicate satellite and Bluetooth fix, and microSD card activity
- Individual features (microSD logging, Bluetooth and LEDs) may be toggled on or off, with settings retained across power-cycles

## Libraries and Compile Requirements
Project Neptune uses the following libraries:
- [EEPROM](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/EEPROM)
- [NeoGPS](https://github.com/SlashDevin/NeoGPS)
- [SdFat](https://github.com/greiman/SdFat)
- [SoftwareSerial](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/softwareSerial)
- [SPI](https://www.arduino.cc/en/reference/SPI)

I had to do the following to compile against the Arduino Nano *Every*, though these changes may no longer be required and are not needed if an older Arduino Nano is used:
- NeoGPS: remove the `class Print` forward declarations from the following files:
    - DMS.h
    - NeoTime.h
- SdFat: set `SPI_DRIVER_SELECT` to `1` in **SdFatConfig.h** per [greiman/SdFat-beta#42](https://github.com/greiman/SdFat-beta/issues/42)
- Change `#define F(str) (str)` in **Arduino.h** to `#define F(str) (const __FlashStringHelper*)(str)`

</p>

Due to the overlapping of the Arduino Nano Every and SPI microSD card adaptor on opposing sides of the PCB, I suggest building in the following sequence:
1. Upload [arduino-gps-logger.ino](./arduino-gps-logger.ino) to Arduino Nano Every
2. Print this repository's STL files; I forget settings used, but note the following:
    - Wall thickness should be adjusted to accommodate heat-set inserts
    - Supports are required only for [Project-Pluto-enclosure-bottom.stl](./STL/Project-Pluto-enclosure-bottom.stl)
    - I've applied gluestick to the printer's bed
3. Insert heat-set inserts to holes on printed [Project-Pluto-enclosure-top.stl](./STL/Project-Pluto-enclosure-top.stl)
4. [Print a PCB](https://jlcpcb.com/) from this repository's Gerber file, with the following settings:
    - 2 layers
    - 1.6mm PCB thickness
5. Solder **220Î© resistors**, **2N2222 NPN transistor** and **2-pin SPST rocker switch** in their respective footprints on the PCB
6. Solder all **straight female headers** from the [Parts List](#Parts-List) to each component's respective footprint on the PCB, except for the microSD card adaptor and HC-05 Bluetooth module
7. Solder **right-angle female headers** to the footprints of the **HC-05 Bluetooth module** and **microSD card adaptor**, slightly tilting back the latter to clear the Arduino Nano Every female header's solder joints
8. Solder **SMT AA battery holder**, ensuring correct orientation of terminals according to footprint on PCB
9. Trim legs of each LED so base rests flush with female headers
10. Plug-in and screw-down (where required) remaining components:
    - HC-05 Bluetooth module
    - u-blox NEO-6M GPS module
    - LLC
    - Pololu 5V step-up voltage regulator
    - Arduino Nano Every
    - LEDs
    - SSD1306 0.96" 128x64 I2C OLED display
    - SPI microSD card adaptor
    - 4-key button-board module
11. Recess the completed unit into the front half of the enclosure, being careful to ensure the LEDs slip properly into their respective cavities
12. Insert AA batteries
13. Screw-down enclosure with 12mm M2 screws (and washers, to avoid fracturing the enclosure)

## Operating Instructions
### Specifications and Requirements
- u-blox NEO-6M GPS and HC-05 Bluetooth modules operate at 4800 baud, for Nikon DLSR-compatibility
- Pairs with any Bluetooth Serial Port Profile (SPP) NMEA 0183-compatible device with PIN/passkey 0000
- microSD card required for logging and waypoint-marking
- When logging is enabled, co-ordinates are written to microSD card at 2-second intervals

### Startup Sequence
1. Any user-changed settings are restored from EEPROM
2. If **Waypoint-Marker** button is held, the HC-05 Bluetooth module is re-configured as follows:
	1. Baud rate set to 4800 as required for Nikon D300(S)/D700 connectivity
	2. PIN set to 0000
	3. Device name set to *Nikon-D300(S)-D700-GPS-Logger*
3. Initialize access to microSD card if one's inserted; else disable logging
4. Set baud rate of u-blox NEO-6M GPS module to 4800 as required for Nikon D300(S)/D700 connectivity
5. Set compatibility mode on u-blox NEO-6M GPS module and co-ordinate-system to 4-decimal places as required for Nikon D300(S)/D700 connectivity
6. Up-and-running

### Button Functions
| Button | Long-Press (3-seconds) |
| --- | --- |
| **Logging Button** (**K1** on button-board; **D5** on PCB) | Toggle logging to microSD card on and off |
| **Bluetooth Button** (**K2** on button-board; **D6** on PCB) | Toggle Bluetooth on and off |
| **Waypoint-Marker Button** (**K3** on button-board; **D7** on PCB) | **During normal use:**<br/>- Record current co-ordinates in file on microSD card, regardless of logging state<br/>- Requires a satellite-fix and microSD card *inserted at boot*<br/><br/>**During startup:**<br/>- Reset baud rate of HC-05 Bluetooth module to 4800 as required for Nikon D300(S)/D700 connectivity |
| **LED Button** (**K4** on button-board; **D8** on PCB) | Toggle LEDs on and off |

### LED Behaviour
- **GPS** (red LED on LED board)
    - Blink: No satellite-fix
    - Solid: Satellite-fix
- **Logging** (yellow LED on LED board)
    - Blink: microSD card activity
    - Solid: microSD card not inserted at boot or error writing to card
- **Bluetooth** (blue LED on LED board)
    - Blink: Searching
    - Solid: Paired
    - Off: Bluetooth is disabled
- Long-pressing a button to toggle individual settings on and off results in the respective LED being lit for 2-seconds to visually indicate a state change

### microSD Card Behaviour
- When logging is on:
  1. File **yymmdd_log_nn.txt** is created in the root of the microSD card with a header row each time logging state is changed to **ON** and a date & time is acquired from the GPS (where **yymmdd** equals current UTC date, and **nn** equals incrementing number beginning with 00)
  2. Given a satellite-fix, the following comma-delimited fields are appended to the file at 2-second intervals
     - Latitude
     - Longitude
     - Speed (km/h)
     - Heading (degrees)
     - Altitude (floating-point meters)
     - Date and Time (UTC)
- Waypoint-markers are appended to file **waypoints.txt** in the same format as above, regardless of logging state
